									<p>Radiation Tool Set is a Web based engineering tools
										that provides design engineers and scientists the necessary
										analytical tools and databases to empower them in evaluation of radiation effects on electronic 
										components used in space, avionics, networks, and security and medical
										systems. 
										
										With the Radiation Tool Set, you can fit heavy ion SEU
										data to the 7-parameters HICUP model (4-Weibull parameters, the sensitive volume dimensions, and funnel length),
										 fit proton test data to a Weibull, convert heavy 
										ion data into equivalent proton SEU characteristics,
										calculate atomospheric nuetron soft error rate, and access individual components 
										TID, SEE, Prompt Dose, and Neutron Displacement damage data and assessment reports in our radiation 
										data base; the largest collection of parts' database</p>

										Each user has a permanent personal account and work space.
										This ensures that the user's input data to the models
										and the results of the computations are not lost when leaving
										the Tool Set. Comparison of different runs is easy;
										thanks to the possibility to define several projects, each
										characterized by its own set of inputs.</p><p>
										We are continuing to add more capabilities to the Tool Set.
